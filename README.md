    ****************************************************************
=====================
General Usage Notes
=====================
	- This particular version is specified for LTSpice/HSPICE.
	- Max threads are limited to 4 in LTSPice, thus limiting performance & extended
	  simulation times.
	- Active Resistor is implemented using NMOS.
	- Further versions can include implementation of MOS as a capacitor, thus improving IC fabrication.

=============
Introduction
=============
    This package contains complete Spice code for an LPF & HPF first order filters implementation on
    LTSpice & HSPICE. Every effort has been made to improve portability of this program. This code
    can be used “as it is” on LTSpice/ HSPICE. However, PSPICE portability is not verified.
    
==========
Features
==========

	-  LPF cutoff frequency ~ 1Khz.
	-  HPF cutoff frequency ~ 28.8 KHz

==============
Installation
==============
Besides the LTSpice/HSpice/PSpice software, you should have VIM, and (optionally) Matlab installed 
on your system.

	- Place “LPF.sp" & "HPF.sp" in your spice directory and then run simulation.

==============================
Summary of Options
==============================
Specified as per the required type of output:

    .Print	- Print(log) requested parameters
    .Plot	- Plot(screen) requested parameters
    .Op	- DC Operating point computations
    .Tran	- Transient analysis
    .AC	- AC analysis

Documentation
===============

    Although extensive explanation of code is provided in the attached spice file,
    further details can be found in the reference documentation along with this project.
    However, basic knowledge of circuits along with familiarity with analog VLSI is required.
   Documentation can be found at [My Git Documentation Page](http://vivekporush.github.io)

Feedback
===========

    If you encounter any bugs or any particular features that are missing,
    please contact me at:

  Porush, Vivek <vporus2@uic.edu> or <vivek.91.porush@gmail.com> or <https://sites.google.com/site/vivekporush91/>
  
    Please feel free to write your macros and extensions.If you send me patches, I will most
    probably include them in future versions of LPF using MOS Active Resistor and maintain them to the best
    of my abilities.;-) I also appreciate any orthographic and grammatical corrections.
